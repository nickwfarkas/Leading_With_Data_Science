# Data Understanding

## Questions to Ask:
1. Do you have enough data?
2. What kind of data is it (Categorical, Discrete, Continous, Mixed)?
3. Distribution of each column?
4. Type of Prediction (Multiclass Classification, Binary Classification, Custering, Forcasting)

## Model Selection:

| Name | Input Data | General Use | Excels In| Bad At|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Logistic Regression | Continous/Categorical | Binary Classification | Low/High Dimensional Data | Multiclass |
| Linear Regression | Continous/Categorical | Regression/Forcasting | Simple Models | Complex Data |
| KNN | Continous/Categorical | Multiclass Classification | Weirdly Distributed Data | High Dimensional Data |
| Neural Networks | Continous/Categorical | Binary Classification/Forcasting | High Dimension/Complex Data | Performance/Non-Normal |
| Naive Bayes | Continous/Categorical | Multiclass/Binary Classification | Categorical Data | Non-Normal |
